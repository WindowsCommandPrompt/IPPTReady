## Notable bugs during the entire development process
<ol> 
  <li align = "justify"> The Firebase Firestore database is unstable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. This would leave room for inconsistency within our application as this is because we cannot 100% guarantee that the application would be able to perform and produce the desired output. If the Firebase Firestore fails in between while the application is being used by the user, then there will be at least a 50% chance that the application will not be able to function as expected </li>
  <li align = "justify"> <b> NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION! </b>. Really annoying error. </li> 
  <li align = "justify"> </li> 
</ol>

## Features of our application 
<ol> 
  <li align = "justify"> Users will be able to view how other people who may or may not be preparing for National Service, through viewing videos that have been directly extracted from the YouTube database via the YouTube API!</li> 
  <li align = "justify"> Users will be able to create their own training cycles to keep track of their training progress through IPPTCycle. </li> 
</ol>

## Notable bugs during the entire development process
<ol> 
  <li align = "justify"> The Firebase Firestore database is unstable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. This would leave room for inconsistency within our application as this is because we cannot 100% guarantee that the application would be able to perform and produce the desired output. If the Firebase Firestore fails in between while the application is being used by the user, then there will be at least a 50% chance that the application will not be able to function as expected </li>
  <li align = "justify"> <b> NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION! </b>. Really annoying error. </li> 
  <li align = "justify"> The values that were supposed to pass from one activity to the other via the intent, is not functioning, ,data is not passed over and then it would result in us not being able to get the expected results from the application. There were some instances where the application was not able to return the correct results when the application has run to a point whereby it is required to return a back a result from some logic based handling.  </li>
